To get this up and running:
- Make sure python is installed from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Once installed, install the following packages:
`python -m pip install --user torch torchvision pillow numpy`

- Then, in `realtime_smile_detector.m`, update `pyenv` to the python path.

Finally, call `run_detector` in the MATLAB command window.
